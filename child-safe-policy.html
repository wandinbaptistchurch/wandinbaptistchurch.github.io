      <li>In line with our mission statement, to ensure that all people in WBC or taking part in WBC activities are
        respected

    <h4>
      3. CHILD SAFETY
    </h4>

    <h5>
      a. Commitment to child safety
    </h5>

    <p>All children who come to WBC have a right to feel and be safe. The welfare of the children in our care will
      always
      be
      our priority and we have a zero tolerance to child abuse. We aim to create a child safe and child friendly
      environment
      where children feel safe.</p>

    <p>This policy applies to all staff, Leaders, volunteers, children and individuals involved in WBC.</p>


    <h5>
      b. Children’s rights to safety and participation
    </h5>

    <p>WBC staff and volunteers encourage children to express their views. We listen to their suggestions, especially on
      matters that directly affect them.</p>

    <p>We actively encourage all children who participate in WBC activities to ‘have a say’ about things that are
      important
      to
      them.</p>

    <p>We teach children about what they can do if they feel unsafe. We listen to and act on any concern’s children, or
      their
      parents, raise with us.</p>


    <h5>
      c. Valuing diversity
    </h5>

    We value diversity and do not tolerate any discriminatory practices.

    To achieve this we:
    <li>promote the cultural safety, participation and empowerment of Aboriginal children and their families</li>
    <li>promote the cultural safety, participation and empowerment of children from culturally and/or linguistically
      diverse
      backgrounds and their families</li>
    <li>welcome children with a disability and their families and act to promote their participation</li>


    <h5>
      d. Recruiting staff
    </h5>

    WBC applies best practice standards in the recruitment and screening of staff.

    We interview and conduct referee checks on all staff and require Working with Children Checks for relevant
    positions.

    Our commitment to Child Safety and our screening requirements are included in all Position Descriptions.

    <h5>
      e. Supporting staff and volunteers
    </h5>

    WBC seeks to attract and retain the best staff and volunteers.<br />

    We provide support and supervision, so staff and volunteers feel valued, respected and fairly treated.<br />

    We have developed a Code of Conduct to provide guidance to our staff and volunteers, all of whom receive training
    and
    guidance on the requirements of the Code of conduct.<br />


    <h5>
      f. Reporting a child safety concern or complaint
    </h5>

    We have appointed a Child Safety Person with the specific responsibility for responding to any child safety
    complaints
    made by staff, volunteers, parents or children.

    Our complaints processes are outlined in the Safe Church Procedures.


    <h5>
      g. Risk Management
    </h5>

    We recognize the importance of a risk management approach to minimizing the potential for child abuse or harm to
    occur
    and use this to inform our policy, procedures and activity planning. In addition to general occupational health and
    safety risks, we proactively manage risks of abuse to our children.
