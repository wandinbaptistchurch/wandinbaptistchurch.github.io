    <h3 class="article__heading--post">Our Beliefs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><i>The Nature and Unity of the Godhead</i>
        <p>There is one God Who is eternal personal Spirit. He is infinite in power, wisdom, holiness, and love. God is
          Triune in essential being and revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
      </li>

      <li><i>The Deity and Humanity of Christ</i>
        <p>Jesus Christ as the second Person of the Godhead is eternally one with God the Father of whose person and
          glory Jesus is the accurate expression. To become human, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the
          virgin Mary, so that two whole and perfect natures, the nature of God and human nature, were united in one
          Person: truly God and truly human.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Holy Spirit</i>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit as the third Person of the Trinity is eternally one with the Father and the Son yet He is sent
          by Them to achieve the divine purpose in the world and in the Church.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Divine Inspiration of the Scriptures</i>
        <p>The Scriptures, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, are the infallible Word of
          God. They were written by holy people of God inspired by the Holy Spirit and have supreme authority in all
          matters of faith and conduct.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Sinfulness of People</i>
        <p>People were made in the image of God and for fellowship with God. By transgression of God’s command humankind
          fell from fellowship with God and their nature was corrupted. As a consequence, all people are spiritually
          dead under Satan’s dominion and control and subject to God’s wrath and condemnation. Therefore, apart from
          God’s grace, people are helpless and hopeless.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Christ’s Atonement for Human Sin</i>
        <p>In order to redeem people from the guilt, penalty and power of sin, Jesus Christ became human and died a
          sacrificial death as our representative substitute. By His resurrection, God’s acceptance of His atoning death
          was demonstrated. This atonement is sufficient for the whole world, but effective only in those who received
          it. The sinner is justified and reconciled to God, not through any personal merit, but solely on the basis of
          God’s gracious gift of salvation in Jesus Christ received through faith.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Work of the Holy Spirit in Salvation</i>
        <p>The ministry of the Holy Spirit is necessary for the acceptance of God’s provision of salvation. The Holy
          Spirit convinces sinners of their sinfulness, leads them to personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour
          and so brings them to spiritual birth as God’s children and to fellowship in Christ. Working within the life
          of believers the Holy Spirit makes real the presence of Christ, witnesses to their relationship with God,
          leads into all truth, bestows gifts for effective service and produces graces for holy living.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Church</i>
        <p>The Church is the body of people whom God has separated from the world through faith in Jesus Christ as their
          Lord and Saviour. All regenerate persons are members of the universal Church of God which takes local form
          wherever groups of believers unite for worship, fellowship, and service in accordance with scriptural
          principles. All believers are called to a priestly ministry in the offering of spiritual sacrifices and sent
          into the world to be witnesses. God calls individuals to positions of oversight and leadership or to special
          ministries. The Church recognises such by ordaining pastors, commissioning missionaries, appointing deacons
          and other leaders, following New Testament practice.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Baptism of Believers by Immersion</i>
        <p>Baptism is an ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a public declaration of a person’s faith in Jesus
          Christ as Lord and Saviour. In accordance with New Testament Scripture, it should be administered by total
          immersion which symbolises the believer’s identification with Christ in death, burial and resurrection, the
          remission of sins and the believer’s dedication of himself to God to live and walk in newness of life.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Communion</i>
        <p>The Lord’s Supper is an ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ instituted by Him to be celebrated with the
          elements of bread and wine by believers in Christ until the end of the age. It commemorates and declares our
          thanks for the Lord’s substitutionary death. The celebration of the ordinance expresses our fellowship with
          and in the Lord Jesus Christ as members of the Body of which He is the Head.</p>
      </li>

      <li><i>The Return of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>
        <p>At the end of this age, according to His promise, Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in His
          glory to the earth. The full consummation of the Kingdom of God awaits His return.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>The Resurrection of the Dead</i>
        <p>At the end of the age, there is to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous. After death
          people’s bodies return to dust, but their spirits return immediately to God – the righteous to be with Him and
          the unrighteous to be reserved for the judgment.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Rewards and Punishments in a Future State</i>
        <p>God has appointed a day of final judgement for the world. At that time Jesus Christ will judge every person
          and each will receive reward or punishment according to their deeds. Those judged righteous, in their
          resurrected and glorified bodies, will receive their reward and will dwell forever in Heaven with the Lord.
          The unrighteous will be consigned to Hell, the place of everlasting punishment.</p>
      </li>
