  <h3 class="article__heading--post">Our Beliefs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><i>God</i> &mdash; Creator and Sustainer of the world who is Holy, righteous and merciful.</li>
    <li><i>Jesus Christ</i> &mdash; The fullness of God in human form who came to earth to reveal God’s mercy to humanity and to pay the price for sin by dying on the cross.</li>
    <li><i>The Holy Spirit</i> &mdash; Part of the Trinity, which is the full presence of God on the earth today. The Spirit is our Advocate and enabler to live the life acceptable to God</li>
    <li><i>The Bible and its use</i> &mdash; God's Word telling of His story with humanity, showing how to live in relationship with Jesus Christ and with others.</li>
    <li><i>Baptism</i> &mdash; To occur upon believing, and is an outward sign of obedience to God which reflects the work of God which has occurred in a believer's life.</li>
    <li><i>Basis for welcoming people into membership of Church</i> &mdash; Upon a request for membership, one or two courses may be taken. If the person has membership in another church, a letter of recommendation is requested from that church, otherwise two or more members visit and interview the person then provide a letter of recommendation to a church meeting. All people who are accepted into membership must have undergone believer's baptism.  Upon acceptance at a church meeting, the person is welcomed into membership at the next celebration of the Lord's Supper.</li>
    <li><i>Lord's Supper</i> &mdash; Sacrament in which the wine and bread represents Christ's blood and body, and in which we remember Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. It is an open table.</li>
    <li><i>The human condition</i> &mdash; Humans are born as sinners and there is nothing that we can do to earn reconciliation with God. Reconciliation comes only through accepting the gift of salvation offered through the work of Christ.</li>
    <li><i>Role of the Pastor</i> &mdash; The shepherd of the congregation who is part of the church community and is the primary provider for pastoral care. They are in charge of the pulpit, preaching or organising speakers for messages in the service, and expected to be prepared to lead with the Lord's Supper.</li>
    <li><i>Role of the congregation</i> &mdash; They are part of the decision-making process through the church business meetings and have the expectation to be salt and light for Christ in the community.</li>
    <li><i>Involvement in wider BUV ministries/events/gatherings</i> &mdash; Not widely involved in recent times, although BUV representatives have now been appointed. The Secretary and Treasurer have been involved in training, and we are starting to have some church members engaging through attendance at the 'Gathering'.</li>
    <li><i>Place of prayer in life of believer/Church</i> &mdash; Prayer is part of the weekly church service which includes specific time for pastoral prayer. We also have our own prayer chain.</li>
