  <p>Larry and Sharon Edwards have been involved in continuous ministry together since 1975 having met in the Salvation Army Training College, Larry in 1973 and Sharon in 1972.</p> 
  <p>They were married in 1975, joining together in a ministry in the Salvation Army that would last until 1995.  During this time, they were in charge of Corps in: Benalla, Swan Hill, Wodonga and Campbelltown SA. </p>
<p>A 4-year term in Argentina was followed by a Corps in Ballarat. In 1989 their ministry changed to Homeless Men’s work, followed by Prison ministry, concluding with time at The Bridge Centre for drug rehab in St Kilda. Three lovely daughters were born during their early ministry years.</p>
<p>God's Holy Spirit led them into The Churches of Christ in 1995, where they served 25 years, pastoring churches in Swan Hill, Springvale South and Dandenong. 
Another turn of God's leading saw Larry taking up interim ministry within the Baptist Church at Millgrove during the time of covid lockdown, concluding this term in December 2022. Larry looks forward with anticipation to getting to know everyone, and sharing life and ministry with the people of Wandin Baptist.</p>
