    <p>On Sunday 11th December 2016, Rev Darrell and Pam McKerlie joined our church. Darrell and Pam were born and bred
      in Sydney. Both have been involved in the Baptist Church for most of their lives. Darrell has been a pastor since
      1971 and was ordained in 1977.</p>
    <p>With his wife Pam they have served in Baptist churches at Kurri Kurri, Mortdale, Matraville, Grafton,
      Murrumbeena, Mooroolbark and Broome. Darrell &amp; Pam are excited to be here because they have a clear call from
      God to join his people in Wandin. The McKerlies have one married son Andrew who with his wife Bronwyn has
      presented them with one grandson and two granddaughters.</p>
    <p>Darrell enjoys gardening, photography and cooking desserts. Pam finds pleasure in needlework, card making,
      entertaining and occasional reading.</p>
